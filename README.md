ML algorithms applications to Mammographic Mass Data Set

Predict the severity (benign or malignant) of a mammographic mass lesion from BI-RADS attributes and the patient's age. The aim is to discriminate benign from malignant cases assuming that all cases with BI-RADS assessments greater or equal a given value (varying from 1 to 5), are malignant
and the other cases are benign.
